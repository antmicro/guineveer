# Introduction

Guineveer is a flexible framework for generating SoCs based on the RISC-V Veer EL2 core.
It provides a simple SoC design that can be modified and expanded with new peripherals.

This documentation is divided into the following chapters:
* {doc}`system_architecture` describes key components and interconnections of the SoC
* {doc}`testing` describes design simulation and testing with Renode and Verilator
* {doc}`user_guide` provides build instructions and describes basic usage
