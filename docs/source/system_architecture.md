# System architecture

## Block diagram

The following diagram illustrates the key components and interconnections of the Guineveer SoC:

The Guineveer System-on-Chip (SoC) employs the VeeR EL2 core which is a 32-bit CPU which supports RISC-Vâ€™s integer (I), compressed instruction (C), multiplication and division (M), and instruction-fetch fence, CSR, and subset of bit manipulation instructions (Z) extensions.

The default configuration of the SoC features an AXI system bus which is used to communicate with a couple of peripherals including an SRAM memory module (accessed via an `AXI_to_mem` interface), an `I3C core`, and an `AXI-to-AHB bridge` providing access to an `OpenTitan UART` peripheral. 
The AXI Interconnect was generated using the [pulp generator](https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi/blob/master/scripts/axi_intercon_gen.py).
